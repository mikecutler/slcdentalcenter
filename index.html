    <p>Welcome to the Salt Lake City Dental Center website, home of your new Salt Lake City Dentist! I hope this site
        will help you get to know ourdental practice a little bit better and be useful in helping you make your choice
        of dentists in Salt Lake. My goal is to create a site that helps you, as a dental patient, gain a greater
        understanding of modern family dentistry and the dental services we offer to all patients, with or without
        dental insurance. As our website grows, I plan to continue adding educational content and stories of real
        patients receiving the treatments they need in our Salt Lake dental clinic. I want to help you understand
        concepts like how getting tooth fillingsbefore cavities progress too far can help avoid more costly procedures,
        how to know when you may need a dental crown, how a root canal isn’t as bad as you think, how mini dental
        implants can stabilize your existing dentures, and how standarddental implants are changing dentistry. And
        ultimately, I want to demonstrate that whether you are looking for basic tooth whitening or a full mouth
        reconstruction, we will do our best to provide the same high quality of service and comfort to every patient.
        Take a look around our site, and check back for updates soon. Thanks for visiting!
        -Dr. Brigham Stoker, DDS (and staff!)</p>
